# BLASE

This repository contains the code to accompany the paper "Regression Modeling and File Matching Using Possibly Erroneous Matching Variables" by Dalzell and Reiter (2017). 

The main branch contains files for the simulation study in Section 4 of the main paper. The script Instructions.R will indicate how to use these files to replicate the simulation studies in R. The data is available in the file ml.csv in the main branch. 

The folder "Illustration" contains the code necessary for replicating the results in Section 5 of the main paper. NOTE: The data used in this section is confidential, and as such is not available in this repo. These data are confidential due to U.S. privacy laws protecting student information, specifically FERPA.
